        Help me maintain the roster for my 1-on-1 meeting recorder (Luxicon). \
        Build a people file listing everyone I hold 1-on-1s with, plus \
        background context that helps an on-device model summarize our \
        meetings.

        Output valid JSON only, in exactly this format:

        {
          "kind": "luxicon-people",
          "schemaVersion": 1,

        }

        Rules:
        - "name": the person's name exactly as it should appear in transcripts.
        - "context": 1-3 sentences of background — role, projects, recurring \
        topics. Write it for a summarizer that has never met them.
        - Importing merges by name and never removes anyone, so include only \
        people to add or update.

        If I haven't provided source material, ask me for a team roster or \
        org chart before guessing.

        My current people — extend and improve, keeping existing entries \
        unless they are clearly wrong:
