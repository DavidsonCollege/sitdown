# Luxicon privacy policy

*Effective 2026-07-09.*

Luxicon is built so that your conversations stay yours.

## What Luxicon collects

Nothing. Luxicon has no accounts, no analytics, no advertising SDKs, and no
servers. The developers receive no data of any kind from the app.

## What stays on your iPhone

Recordings, transcripts, summaries, your voice fingerprint (a 256-number
embedding, not audio), your people list, and your vocabulary are stored in
the app's private container on your device. They are protected with iOS
Data Protection and are included in your standard iPhone backup (encrypted
by Apple; end-to-end encrypted if you enable Advanced Data Protection).

## Network connections the app makes

- **Speech model download** (required, first use): models are fetched from
  Hugging Face. No user data is sent — it is a file download.
- **Mac sync** (optional, off by default): if you pair a Mac, transcripts
  and summaries you choose to push travel over your local network to that
  Mac, encrypted with a key derived from your pairing token. They do not
  cross the internet.
- **Vocabulary URL sync** (optional, off by default): if you configure a
  vocabulary URL, the app fetches that file over https when opened.

That is the complete list. Without those optional features, Luxicon works
in airplane mode after the model download.

## Sharing

Nothing leaves the app unless you export or push it. What you share — and
with whom — is up to you.
